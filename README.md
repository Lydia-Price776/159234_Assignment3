This assignment required us to create a data base system for a computer store. 

In this system, general users are able to:
- Filter products by category and their subcategories
- View individual device information

Managers are able to do everything a regular user can do and:
- Add new devices
- Update the information of current devices
- Delete devices 
- Clear the current device selected
